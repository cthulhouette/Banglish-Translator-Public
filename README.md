Welcome to my first Webapp.

Started working on this since 15.12.2024, two days before my semester finals. Final release is at 24.12.2024, today.

Took help of ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, and Lovable AI. Learned a ton. Rizz should be through the roof.

Coding is hard, but to survive and thrive in 4IR, it is a mandatory skill.

However, enjoy this silly little product, have fun, and teach all the murad takla people out there!
